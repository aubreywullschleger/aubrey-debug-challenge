    	<h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey! My name is Aubrey, but most people call me Aubrey. I am a Colorado native.  I have a twin brother, and no, we are not identical.</p>
        <p> My family and friends are my most favorite things in the world. Beyond that, I'm a big fan of: dogs, craft beer, camping, basketball, burritos, comics, Breaking Bad, Adventure Time, Tim Burton, Hayao Miyazaki, rocks, gymnastics, boating, music/concerts, coffee, and cheese.</p>
        <p>I do things sometimes too, including: hand-lettering, screen print experimentation, painting, drawing, playing guitar horribly, boxing, long-boarding, cooking, experimenting with makeup, and exploring new places.</p>
